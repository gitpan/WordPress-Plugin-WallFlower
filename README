The intention for this plug-in is to integrate wordpress blogs with
social media.  It acts as the glue layer for cross-site
authentication using trusted third parties Ã  la Kerberos or OpenID.
Authorization checks with RADIUS and/or Diameter.  Audit reports to
local and remote storage.  That sort of thing.
